title:'Interpreter Design pattern'
...
The Interpreter design pattern is used to define a grammar for a language and provide an interpreter to interpret sentences in the language. It involves creating classes that represent different grammar rules and using them to build an abstract syntax tree (AST) for a given input. The interpreter then traverses the AST to evaluate or perform actions based on the input.

Here's a simplified example of implementing the Interpreter pattern in Python:

```python
# Abstract Expression
class Expression:
    def interpret(self, context):
        pass

# Terminal Expression
class NumberExpression(Expression):
    def __init__(self, number):
        self.number = number

    def interpret(self, context):
        return self.number

# Non-terminal Expression
class AddExpression(Expression):
    def __init__(self, left, right):
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

    def interpret(self, context):
        return self.left.interpret(context) + self.right.interpret(context)

# Client
def main():
    context = {}

    num1 = NumberExpression(10)
    num2 = NumberExpression(5)
    add = AddExpression(num1, num2)

    result = add.interpret(context)
    print("Result:", result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this example, we have the `Expression` class representing the abstract expression. The `NumberExpression` class is a terminal expression that represents a number, and the `AddExpression` class is a non-terminal expression that represents addition.

The `interpret` method in each expression class evaluates the expression based on the context. The client (in the `main` function) creates expression objects and composes them to build an abstract syntax tree (AST). Finally, the client uses the interpreter to evaluate the AST and obtain the result.

This example provides a basic understanding of the Interpreter pattern. In more complex scenarios, you would define a more comprehensive grammar and build a more sophisticated AST to interpret complex sentences in the language. The pattern is especially useful for implementing domain-specific languages or for tasks involving parsing and processing textual input.
