title: 'Client Server Pattern'
...
Designing a client-server architecture involves creating a system where one or more client applications interact with one or more server applications over a network. While Python doesn't have a specific "client-server design pattern," you can implement client-server interactions using various design patterns and libraries. One common approach is to use the "Client-Server" model in conjunction with appropriate design patterns and networking libraries.

Here's a basic example of implementing a simple client-server interaction in Python using the socket library:

**Server (server.py):**
```python
import socket

def main():
    server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    server_socket.bind(("127.0.0.1", 12345))
    server_socket.listen(1)

    print("Server listening on port 12345")

    client_socket, client_address = server_socket.accept()
    print(f"Connection established with {client_address}")

    while True:
        data = client_socket.recv(1024)
        if not data:
            break
        client_socket.send(data)

    print("Connection closed")
    client_socket.close()
    server_socket.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Client (client.py):**
```python
import socket

def main():
    client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    client_socket.connect(("127.0.0.1", 12345))

    message = "Hello, server!"
    client_socket.send(message.encode())

    response = client_socket.recv(1024)
    print("Received from server:", response.decode())

    client_socket.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this example, we're using the socket library to create a basic client-server interaction. The server listens on a specified port and waits for a connection from a client. Once a connection is established, the server receives data from the client and sends it back. The client connects to the server, sends a message, receives the response, and then closes the connection.

Please note that this is a simplified example, and real-world client-server interactions can involve more complexity, error handling, and security considerations. Depending on your requirements, you might consider using higher-level networking libraries, such as `socketserver`, or even frameworks like Flask or Django for building more feature-rich and robust client-server applications.
